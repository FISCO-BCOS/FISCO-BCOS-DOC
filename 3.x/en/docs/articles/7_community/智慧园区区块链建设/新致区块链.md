### Analysis of the Current Situation of the Development of Smart Park
&emsp;&emsp;The information construction of the smart park is a systematic project, blockchain technology needs to consider the application scheme from the actual needs, the use of innovative ways to complete the advanced technology。
Therefore, it is very important to tap the advantages and characteristics of blockchain and apply blockchain technology to the construction of smart parks。  
&emsp;&emsp;Digital wisdom park development for many years, a variety of parks more and more。The rapid development of digital parks is mainly due to the following factors: from the economic factors, the rapid development of downstream industries, promoting the rapid development of the park；Political factors, the "13th Five-Year Plan" in the wisdom of the park was proposed, in recent years to obtain policy support, so to rapid development。From a technical point of view, cutting-edge technologies such as big data, AI and 5G have slowly penetrated from first-tier cities into the construction of parks in second-, third- and even fourth-tier cities, so the overall development momentum of digital smart park construction is still relatively rapid。  
&emsp;&emsp;In the face of such rapid development, there are still some pain points in the development of digital wisdom parks in China, which are mainly reflected in:
- First of all, the major parks are geographically scattered, and the problem of information islands is more serious。In addition, a large number of application systems, including hardware systems, Internet of Things software, etc., have been piled up in the past, both traditional and new, but the efficiency of operation and maintenance is not necessarily high under various systems。
- Secondly, the homogenization of park construction。The so-called homogenization is that the first batch of smart parks in the development, as a local benchmark, other parks began to imitate the benchmark construction, so the construction of the park is very similar, not much innovation。
- Again, without the construction of the park ecology, it is difficult to form a closed loop。The earliest wisdom park construction did not mention ecology, but the overall design is more intelligent。
- Finally, the need for more forward-looking planning, low external scalability。

### On-Chain Campus Solutions
&emsp;&emsp;Data generation value is the core of the construction of smart parks, in this process, how to ensure the credibility and authenticity of data, blockchain technology traceability, non-tampering and other characteristics here can play its role。

&emsp;&emsp;The overall data architecture diagram of the smart park construction, the leftmost is familiar data sources, basic data, platform data, the park data from the perception layer, the basic data collected, including government data and enterprise-owned data, uploaded to the new chain, through the verification of the data is true, upload and save the certificate can ensure that the data can not be tampered with。In this context, we then perform data mining, which in turn generates valuable data。On the far right we see asset portraits, park portraits, corporate portraits, and personnel portraits derived from data mining so that the relevant agencies can provide better services to users。

&emsp;&emsp;The overall system architecture of the park construction is shown in the figure above. The whole architecture can be roughly divided into three parts: external coordination of the park, internal operation coordination of the park, and coordination of the underlying perception technology / cloud chain technology。The next level is the operational collaboration within the park, which connects the business content, including online and offline business data, and the most external is the platform's user system。

### Application of blockchain in the implementation process
&emsp;&emsp;First of all, the entire underlying layer is actually the blockchain BaaS platform, including network nodes and chain management。The most important thing is the alliance chain of the park, which not only regards the park as a certification node, but also includes enterprises and even some government agencies into the certification node and into the entire blockchain ecology, so as to ensure that a complete blockchain park ecosystem is truly established。
&emsp;&emsp;At the bottom, we chose FISCO BCOS, which is mainly based on the business scenarios of the alliance chain for selection and comparison. After comparison, we found that FISCO BCOS has the following advantages:
- High node scalability, you can easily add and delete nodes。
- Smart contracts support EVM, you can use the current popular language Solidity to write smart contracts, easy to use。
-Support distributed database, support KV database, can easily query data, keep the history traceable。
- Support national secrets, friendly to domestic regulatory needs。
- Support node admission control, flexible access control, to achieve comprehensive security。
- Support regulators and auditors to join the alliance chain as observation nodes to obtain real-time data for regulatory audits。
- The community is mature, the project iteration speed is fast, the corresponding ecological tools are many, the community has more than 40000 members and more than 2000 enterprises to participate。

&emsp;&emsp;On-chain Park Effect and Prospect
&emsp;&emsp;After several years of development, the digital smart park 1.0 stage has been basically completed, this stage mainly carried out digital construction, adding 5G, Internet of Things technology, the future, blockchain will penetrate into the park construction, so as to achieve from 1.0 to 2.0 construction direction。  
&emsp;&emsp;As an infrastructure, blockchain must be combined with practical application scenarios and integrated with various cutting-edge technologies to truly solve the pain points in the construction of the park。Now that the cloud construction of most parks is relatively mature, how to combine blockchain with existing cloud technology to play a greater value in this process will be an important proposition for the 2.0 phase of exploration
&emsp;&emsp;As far as blockchain technology is concerned, the future imagination is still relatively large, according to different types of parks, collect different types of data, mine different potential values, and provide more reference value for the demand side。
