# Alliance Chain to Subtract Blockchain

Author: Liang Yongfu ｜ Blockchain Architect

The current alliance chain platform adjusts the consensus mechanism on the basis of the public chain, removes the public attribute, makes access controllable and improves efficiency, which is actually a subtraction of the blockchain。But is that enough?？

We quickly found in the application that the use of the alliance chain is more limited, a chain can basically only do one business, and the expansion of members will face a lot of problems, this expansion is not to add a node in technology, but to add a participant in the business。

The question is what data the newly added member can see and what data he can't see, and sometimes he may only need to know a few of them, most of which he doesn't need to see。How to solve the current alliance chain platform？You might say, build another chain, and then do cross-chain。

Cross-chain is also the focus of what we are doing now, because we see such a problem。But why can't we think about whether blockchain itself can be done from another perspective, after all, using cross-chain means acknowledging that blockchain is creating new information silos。It's just that I used to be "lonely" in one place, but now I'm "lonely" in a circle, which doesn't actually solve the problem of allowing information to flow and share smoothly。

Satoshi Nakamoto thought of blockchain as a genius solution when he created Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean it's the only solution。

Since it is the solution, what problem does it solve?？Identify the problem, and then think about it. Maybe you can find a new solution?。Or make some improvements to the blockchain to make it more suitable for current business needs。

Why do you want to subtract the blockchain?？Because the blockchain is now designed to be too extreme, with extreme requirements for immutability and traceability, it will be sacrificed in other areas, such as privacy protection, performance。Therefore, subtraction is needed to reduce the support for these two features to improve the satisfaction of other requirements, such as removing historical state data and removing the merkle tree。

So, what aspects of the blockchain can be subtracted?？

Is it possible to improve the form of global unique chain now?？Why a globally unique chain?？Why can't there be multiple chains in the block chain network？Is it feasible to track only one event per chain？Add some tamper-proof mechanisms to the chain generation process, or even without adding them, because the alliance chain does not have to be completely autonomous and completely decentralized like the public chain。

The alliance chain is a business chain that operates under current business rules, and if there are problems that have been solved by business rules, do we have to solve them at the technical level?？If there are government agencies+Third-party commercial endorsement in it, we still need to spend a lot of energy to solve the problem of tamper proof?？

When we talk about the blockchain, we are talking about the blockchain network. My point has always been that the blockchain has two important attributes, one is storage and the other is network。However, most platforms nowadays have no boundaries between the two, and blockchain networks are about storing data, or each node is full of data。

Can the functions of storage and network be more clearly distinguished?？The network is made into an open network, which can be accessed by any organization, but the network nodes do not store data, do not sense the data, only forward the data, and endorse the data transmission process through the application layer protocol。Data nodes store data, but they do not store all the data transmitted in the network, and each data can be routed through the network to the data node that needs to be stored。

Combined with the above-mentioned reduction of the globally unique chain, whether it is possible to build an open blockchain network, participating institutions can freely choose the data transmission path and storage nodes？Thus forming an open trusted storage network。Only then can blockchain exist as an infrastructure, just like 5G

Technology's over-pursuit of one aspect often leaves other aspects missing。While the alliance chain subtracts the blockchain, it actually adds in other ways, not allowing the blockchain to be too partial to the student。
