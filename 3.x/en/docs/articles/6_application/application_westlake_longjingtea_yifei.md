Author ： Yi Fei ｜ Tian Yan Wei Zhen CTO

## <center> ***01 Project Background***
#### 1.1 Business requirements

West Lake Longjing is the first of the top ten famous teas and one of Hangzhou's unique business cards。Located on Longjing Road at the foot of Shifeng Mountain in Longjing Village, Hangzhou West Lake Longjing Tea Leaf Co。The company created the "Gong" brand West Lake Longjing, as the country's gift tea, enjoys a high reputation at home and abroad。It is hoped that through digital transformation, the use of cutting-edge technology will break the traditional tea industry chain pattern and gradually move towards digital and intelligent development。

#### 1.2 Solutions

- To build a "digital tribute card" as the goal, around the variety protection, ecological tea garden, production management, tea tourism and other aspects, to build a "digital tribute card" industry digital foundation, the use of Internet of Things, blockchain, 5G and other technologies as the "digital tribute card" construction of technical support。Empowering industries with numbers to enhance industrial value。

- The establishment of "digital tea garden," "digital production," "digital display" and other three digital systems, for production and operation, regulatory services, decision-making analysis to provide multi-dimensional, multi-scene brand building services, to achieve "data to speak, data decision-making, data management, data innovation," with data to empower the "digital tribute brand" brand building。

#### 2.1 Digital Tea Garden

- Meteorological environment monitoring
- Soil moisture monitoring
- Visual video surveillance
- pest monitoring and early warning

#### 2.2 Digital Production - Production Planning Management
The production plan management system is the management of the enterprise plan, including the development of plans, the implementation of plans, the completion of plans and other three aspects of the work。The production plan of the enterprise is mainly divided into field management plan, irrigation plan, plant protection plan, fertilization plan, harvest plan and so on。Only by making a production plan can an enterprise reasonably arrange the operation and management of the production process。

#### 2.3 Digital Production - Planting Management
The system provides professional and standard production file information forms for the planting process of planting products, the production files are customized according to the characteristics of tea trees and production standards and enterprise standards, and the production files are collected according to the production batches of the enterprise to realize the integrity of the production file data and ensure that every production batch of the enterprise is documented。

## <center> ***03 Blockchain+ Traceability***
#### 3.1 What is Traceability

#### 3.2 How to trace
After consumers buy the product, they only need to scan the two-dimensional code ID card on the product to understand the product origin, producer, breeding information, pesticide fertilization information, various detection and circulation information, manufacturers, product brand stories, etc。

#### 3.3 Business Pain Points
With the traceability system, each local characteristic product from where to where to go, the middle through which circulation links, can be traced back to the source

#### 3.4 Blockchain+ Traceability

![](../../../images/articles/application_westlake_longjingtea_yifei/IMG_5659.PNG)
Take advantage of blockchain's decentralized and tamper-resistant features。Chain process data for agricultural product traceability。When the traceability process data is linked, the data will be traceable and cannot be tampered with, which can effectively prove the authenticity and validity of the traceability data。

## <center> ***04 Technical Discussion***
#### 4.1 Blockchain+IoT
Compared with the traditional manual filling method, the automatic collection of agricultural situation data through IoT devices ensures the authenticity of the process data source from the source. Based on the BSN alliance chain, we use the smart contract mechanism to chain the data, ensuring the transparency of the chain process, and at the same time, based on the Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanism to achieve data tampering prevention。In the consumer-oriented traceability code, "Xingnong Code" is based on the one-product-one-code model, providing each tea product with a globally unique blockchain authentication certificate, the electronic certificate records in detail the tea planting process of each link data hash, on-chain timestamp and other information, the certificate of the whole process of traceability data are stored in the BSN alliance chain of city nodes, through the "chain network" solution blockchain+The landing of traceability applications has been greatly improved。
