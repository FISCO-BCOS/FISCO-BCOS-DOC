Author: Little Assistant

In 2023, the world is changing, and science and technology are changing with each passing day。FISCO BCOS adheres to the belief in blockchain technology, bringing together more than 5,000 enterprises and institutions and more than 100,000 individual members to build co-governance and share, creating a more active and prosperous open source alliance chain ecosystem。

Over the past year, a large number of open source contributors have joined us to support the development of FISCO BCOS open source in many directions, from code, tools, solutions and sermons。More than 100 small partners contribute code to FISCO BCOS, bringing a more robust and powerful FISCO BCOS to the community；More than ten teams contribute tool components and solutions to the open source community, further enriching open source ecological components and application cases；More than 60 partners have become the "tap water" of FISCO BCOS, and have spontaneously exported technical interpretations, operational practices and application cases to promote FISCO BCOS as community preachers。

We have compiled the FISCO BCOS Contributor Honor Roll 2023, and thank you for your enthusiastic participation and active contributions！

Grow up, root down。Power from the community is a solid base to support FISCO BCOS technology leadership and ecological prosperity。We believe that a more dynamic and prosperous blockchain industry is coming。Looking forward to more small partners to join us and build a better future for blockchain。

**Program name: AI4C - AIGC-oriented creation of cultural digital product operation platform**

Core participants: Yu Zhenqi, Hu Xin, Sun Yan, Yang Guoming

At present, AIGC cultural creation faces many problems, such as the difficulty of storing and checking massive materials, the untrustworthy reasoning under the chain, the difficulty of protecting product copyright, and the opaque distribution of benefits。In order to solve the above problems, the team built a copyright operation platform for AIGC creation of cultural digital products。The platform integrates six key functions, such as trusted copyright identification, to realize the whole process of cultural and digital copyright services。Carry out research on on-chain storage retrieval and off-chain trusted extension technology, and design a cultural digital product operation plan。The platform and FISCO BCOS blockchain have been developed and deployed, and trusted computing hardware is used to support the privacy calculation and reasoning acceleration of the generative model。

**Scheme Name: Integrated Supply Chain Carbon Footprint System Based on Blockchain**

Core participants: Deng Yitian, Liang Haotian, Wang Weijie, Xuan Haojun, Ren Xuhao

Traditional supply chain vendors usually store carbon footprint data in their own local databases, resulting in the inability to circulate database data between different supply chain vendors, making it difficult to synchronize carbon footprint data。This work proposes a "blockchain-based supply chain carbon footprint unified system"。The system consists of three key technologies, including a blockchain-oriented fine-grained access control technology, an on-chain, off-chain hybrid storage architecture, and an efficient on-chain, off-chain collaboration mechanism。The system enables synchronization and consistency of data across supply chain vendors, helping companies achieve their "dual carbon" goals。

**Scheme name: second-hand tide play trading platform based on blockchain and emotional sustenance**

Core participants: Lu Longji, Gao Tao, Wu Jiaheng, Yuan Yao, Lin Jiaer

The project aims to build a more credible, efficient, safe and warm second-hand trendy trading platform, enhance the user experience through emotional storage and original rights confirmation, use blockchain technology to keep emotional stories forever, protect original content, reduce fraud and malicious behavior in the transaction process, and promote the healthy development of the second-hand trading market。The innovation of this project is to make emotions generate value and protect the rights and interests of the original creators. At the beginning of the project, in the promising second-hand trading market, the project focused on the special category of second-hand trendplay, linking the emotions of buyers and sellers with stories and commodities to resonate: allowing sellers to sell their goods at higher prices through emotional assignment；At the same time for the most emotional needs of buyers, to provide emotional consumption place。

**Scheme Name: Ask Chain - ESG Rating System Based on Blockchain**

Core participants: Zheng Huiwen, Zhong Nanhai, Li Zhiyuan

In the context of sustainable development, ESG assessment has become an important indicator of corporate sustainability。However, there is a lack of a unified, transparent and efficient ESG evaluation platform in the current market。Existing assessment tools often face problems such as inconsistent scoring standards, opaque data, easy tampering, and process redundancy, which not only affects the fairness of the assessment, but also increases the operating costs of the enterprise。Therefore, the development of a blockchain-based ESG scoring system aims to provide enterprises with a reliable, transparent and easy-to-operate ESG assessment solution, which has significant advantages in terms of cost efficiency and is suitable for use by enterprises of all sizes, assessment agencies and relevant regulatory agencies。
