FISCO BCOS supports implementing smart contracts in several ways

* [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)The contract programming language used in the Ethereum ecosystem, FISCO BCOS expands a series of functions for the alliance chain, and is the most commonly used way to develop smart contracts on FISCO BCOS。
* [Pre-Compiled Contract](./c++_contract/add_precompiled_impl.md): Built-in customized smart contracts directly inside blockchain nodes, using c++Language implementation, can directly call the node internal various interfaces, for complex scenarios, the use of high barriers to entry。
* [WBC-Liquid](./Liquid_develop.md)The Rust-based smart contract programming language developed by the micro-blockchain, with the help of Rust language features, can achieve more powerful programming functions than the Solidity language。



WBC-Liquid is a Rust-based smart contract programming language developed by Weizhong Blockchain. With the help of Rust language features, it can achieve more powerful programming functions than Solidity language. For related tutorials, see:
