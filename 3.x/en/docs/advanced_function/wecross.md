Tag: "Cross Chain"

------
The WeCross Blockchain Cross-Chain Collaboration Platform is an independently developed and fully open-source research result in cross-chain technology, supporting FISCO BCOS。

Based on a package of self-developed and open-source blockchain technology solutions, WeCross has developed a blockchain cross-chain collaboration platform - WeCross - to promote cross-industry, institutional and regional cross-blockchain trust transfer and business cooperation。It realizes one-stop cross-chain management, plug-in cross-chain intervention, unified cross-chain identity, unified cross-chain resource paradigm, and ensures cross-chain transaction asset atomic exchange and contract cross-chain call。

WeCross focuses on addressing the existing challenges in the blockchain industry, not limited to meeting the trusted data exchange requirements of homogeneous blockchains after parallel expansion, but also further explores effective solutions to the problem of interconnection between heterogeneous blockchains due to the multi-dimensional heterogeneity of the underlying architecture, data structure, interface protocol, security mechanism, etc。As the infrastructure of future blockchain interconnection, WeCross adheres to the concept of multi-party participation, shared resources, intelligent collaboration and value integration, and is fully open source to the public。
