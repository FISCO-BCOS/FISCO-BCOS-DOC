#  5. Truora, the Trusted Prophecy Machine
Tag: "prophecy machine" "" Truora ""

-----

Truora is an oracle service based on the FISCO BCOS platform, supporting FISCO BCOS2.x and 3.x versions。

Truora uses off-chain Java services to monitor on-chain oracle contract events, initiate off-chain resource access and computation tasks, and return the results to the on-chain oracle contract for on-chain use.。

Truora supported features:

1) Get external data (http / https) and write the results back to the chain for on-chain contract validation and use。

2) Generate random numbers under the chain for on-chain verification, i.e. VRF can verify random numbers.。

3) Object-oriented implementation, can extend more on-chain event monitoring, off-chain data acquisition / calculation and trusted verification logic。
