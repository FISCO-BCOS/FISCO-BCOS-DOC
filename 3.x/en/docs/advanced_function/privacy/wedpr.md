------

WeDPR-Lab is a series of instant-available scenario-based efficient privacy protection solution suites and services, see WeDPR white paper, independently developed by the micro-bank blockchain team.。The solution is dedicated to solving the privacy protection risks and pain points in business digitization, such as privacy is not "hidden," sharing and collaboration is not controllable, eliminating privacy concerns of privacy subjects and compliance barriers for business innovation, helping to interconnect core values and explore emerging businesses based on privacy data, creating a fair, peer-to-peer and win-win multi-party data collaboration environment, and achieving a controllable balance between cross-subject integration of data values and data governance.。

WeDPR-Lab has the following features and advantages:

1. Scenario-based solutions: Based on common scenario requirements, efficient technical solution framework templates such as public verifiable ciphertext ledger, multi-party ciphertext decision-making, multi-party ciphertext ranking, multi-party ciphertext calculation, multi-party secure random number generation, selective ciphertext disclosure, etc., have been extracted, which can be applied to payment, supply chain finance, cross-border finance, voting, election, list,。
2. Instant availability: high performance, high ease of use, cross-platform and cross-language implementation, does not rely on centralized trusted services, does not rely on trusted hardware, supports national secret algorithm standards, public and verifiable privacy effects, and builds sample applications in 5 minutes.。
3. Transparent and controllable: privacy control returns to the owner, prevents unauthorized use of data, and further realizes that the whole process of data use can be supervised, traceable and verifiable on the basis of "data available but not visible."。

WeDPR-Lab fully embraces openness and will open source a series of core algorithm components to further enhance the transparency of system security and provide more transparent and credible privacy protection effects.。WeDPR-Lab is a collection of open source core algorithm components.。
