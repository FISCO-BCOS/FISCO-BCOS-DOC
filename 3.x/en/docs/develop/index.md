# 1. Application Development Guide
Tag: 'Application Development'

----
The application development section aims to guide users to learn more about the FISCO BCOS blockchain and use the corresponding components for development based on the rich functions and components provided by FISCO BCOS。This section mainly includes the following parts:

1. Blockchain RPC interface: This section provides an introduction to the Java API interface for blockchain application developers. You can use this section to familiarize yourself with how to deploy and invoke contracts。
2. Account usage and account management: This section specifically introduces how to create, store, and use accounts for blockchain application developers, and guides developers to create and operate accounts on demand。
3. Contract lifecycle and permission management: This section provides application developers with a detailed introduction to the entire lifecycle of contracts from development, deployment, invocation, upgrade, freezing to revocation, as well as the roles and management methods involved in the entire smart contract lifecycle。
4. Console deployment invocation contract: This section describes how application developers download the configuration console and guides developers on how to deploy and invoke contracts through the console。
5. SmartDev application development components: SmartDev development components for blockchain application developers to provide a comprehensive library of smart contracts, for commonly used functions, do not have to repeat the wheel, just quote on demand, you can introduce the corresponding functions, for the efficiency of contract development and security escort。This section is intended to guide blockchain application developers to familiarize themselves with SmartDev components。
6. Use AMOP function: FISCO BCSO provides AMOP function (Advanced Messages Onchain Protocol), through this section, guide users to use the AMOP protocol to communicate with other organizations, through the specified interface to accept the system push message。
7. Use group ring signature and homomorphic encryption: FISCO BCOS integrates homomorphic encryption and group / ring signature verification functions in the form of precompiled contracts, providing a variety of privacy protection methods。
8. Smart Contract Security Practices: Describes the best practices and security measures that should be used at all stages of coding, deployment, operation, and maintenance of smart contracts。
