Use manual:


FISCO BCOS outputs the key steps in the blockchain node to the 'log _% YYY% mm% dd% HH.% MM' file in the 'nodeX / log /' directory, and the log format is customized, so that users can view the running status of the blockchain through logs。

Users can quickly understand the status of blockchain nodes and the basis of transaction execution errors through log files, and can use other audit tools to capture logs to obtain the actual status of the blockchain。
