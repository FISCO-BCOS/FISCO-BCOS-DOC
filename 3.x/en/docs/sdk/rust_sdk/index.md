-The positioning of this project is a project of learning / research / programming interest, for learning reference only。If you have formal requirements for use, it is recommended that you develop your own production-level sdk with only partial reference to this project and FISCO BCOS-related implementations, and use it after rigorous testing and verification。
  
- This project is not the only and official fisco bcos rust sdk, the community will have other excellent rust sdk implementation, providing a variety of options and reference possibilities

- This project temporarily supports FISCO BCOS 2.0.0 and above. Currently, FISCO BCOS 3.0.0 and above are being adapted
