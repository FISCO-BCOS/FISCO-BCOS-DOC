# Generate Java interface files for smart contracts

In the console 'console' and 'java-sdk-demo "provides tools that can be generated from the 'solidity' contract to call the 'java' tool class of the contract.。In this example, use "console" to generate the Solidity contract to call the contract 'java' tool class as an example.。

> Experience webankblockchain-liquid (hereinafter referred to as WBC-Liquid), please refer to subsection 5。
>
> Using "java-sdk-For an example of demo "see section 7。

## 1. Download Console

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/fisco && cd ~/fisco
# Get Console
$ curl -#LO https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/console/releases/download/v3.6.0/download_console.sh

# If the preceding command cannot be executed for a long time due to network problems, try the following command:
$ curl -#LO https://gitee.com/FISCO-BCOS/console/raw/master/tools/download_console.sh

$ bash download_console.sh
$ cd ~/fisco/console
```

## 2. Place the contract in the contract directory of the console.

**Then, place the Solidity smart contract you want to use in the "~ / fisco / console / contracts / solidity" directory**。This time we use HelloWorld.sol in the console as an example.。Ensure that HelloWorld.sol is in the specified directory。

```shell
# Current Directory ~ / fisco / console
$ ls contracts/solidity 
```

get back

```shell
HelloWorld.sol  KVTableTest.sol ShaTest.sol KVTable.sol ...
```

## 3. Generate the Java class that calls the smart contract.

```shell
# Current Directory ~ / fisco / console
$ bash contract2java.sh solidity -p org.com.fisco -s ./contracts/solidity/HelloWorld.sol
# The parameter "org.com.fisco" in the above command is the package name to which the generated java class belongs。
# Via the command. / contract2java.sh-H can view the script usage method
```

get back

```shell
*** Compile solidity HelloWorld.sol*** 
INFO: Compile for solidity HelloWorld.sol success.
*** Convert solidity to java  for HelloWorld.sol success ***
```

The use of 'contract2java.sh' will be described in detail in Appendix 2.。

View Compilation Results

```shell
$ ls contracts/sdk/java/org/com/fisco 
# get back
# HelloWorld.java
```

After running successfully, the java, abi, and bin directories will be generated in the 'console / contracts / sdk' directory, as shown below。

```shell
|-- abi # The abi directory generated by compilation, which stores the abi file compiled by the solidity contract
|   |-- HelloWorld.abi
|-- bin # The bin directory generated by compilation, which stores the bin file compiled by the Solidity contract
|   |-- HelloWorld.bin
|-- java  # Store the compiled package path and Java contract file
|   |-- org
|       |-- com
|           |-- fisco
|               |-- HelloWorld.java # Solidity Compiled HelloWorld Java File
```

The 'org / com / fisco /' package path directory is generated in the Java directory。The Java contract file 'HelloWorld.java' will be generated in the package path directory.。where 'HelloWorld.java' is the Java contract file required by the Java application。

## 4. The generated Java file code structure.

The following takes the generated interface list of 'HelloWorld.java' as an example to briefly explain the code structure。

```java
public class HelloWorld extends Contract {
    / / constructor
    protected HelloWorld(String contractAddress, Client client, CryptoKeyPair credential);
    / / Obtain the code of the contract according to the CryptoSuite. If the code is the national secret, return the code of the national secret.
    public static String getBinary(CryptoSuite cryptoSuite);
    / / Get the ABI json string of the contract
    public static String getABI();
    / / HelloWorld contract get interface
    public String get() throws ContractException;
    / / The Function class of the HelloWorld contract get interface, which records the input and return types and can be used for ABI parsing
    public Function getMethodGetRawFunction() throws ContractException;
    / / The HelloWorld contract set interface. Enter the string type and return the transaction receipt.
    public TransactionReceipt set(String n);
    / / The Function class of the HelloWorld contract set interface, which records the input and return types and can be used for ABI parsing
    public Function getMethodSetRawFunction(String n) throws ContractException;
    / / Obtain the signed transaction calling the set interface, which can be sent directly to the chain.
    public String getSignedTransactionForSet(String n);
    / / The HelloWorld contract set asynchronous interface. Enter the string type and return the transaction hash.
    public String set(String n, TransactionCallback callback);
    / / Input parsing of the HelloWorld contract set
    public Tuple1<String> getSetInput(TransactionReceipt transactionReceipt);
    / / If there is a known HelloWorld contract on the chain, you can directly load the Java HelloWorld class using the modified interface.。Note: ABI must be the same, otherwise the call fails
    public static HelloWorld load(String contractAddress, Client client, CryptoKeyPair credential);
    / / Initiate the deployment contract operation on the chain and return the Java HelloWorld class。
    public static HelloWorld deploy(Client client, CryptoKeyPair credential) throws ContractException;
}
```

## 5. Generate WBC-Java interface file for Liquid contract

Similar to the Solidity contract above, if you want to experience the webankblockchain-liquid (hereinafter referred to as WBC-Liquid) deployment operations, the console also provides you with examples.。

Before using it, ensure the compilation environment of the cargo liquid. For details about how to use it, see: https://liquid-doc.readthedocs.io/。

### 5.1 WBC-Compilation of Liquid Contracts

You can view it under contracts / liquid in the dist directory of the console. The following is an example of hello _ world:

```shell
$ ls contracts/liquid
asset_test    hello_world   kv_table_test

$ cd contracts/liquid/hello_world

# Compiling with cargo liquid
$ cargo liquid build
[1/4] 🔍  Collecting crate metadata
[2/4] 🚚  Building cargo project
[3/4] 🔗  Optimizing Wasm bytecode
[4/4] 📃  Generating ABI file

✨ Done in 1 minute, your project is ready now:
Binary: ~/fisco/contracts/liquid/hello_world/target/hello_world.wasm
   ABI: ~/fisco/console/dist/contracts/liquid/hello_world/target/hello_world.abi
```

Generate 'hello _ world.wasm' and 'hello _ world.abi' files

### 5.2 WBC-Liquid Contract Generating Java Files

```shell
# Current Directory ~ / fisco / console
$ bash contract2java.sh liquid -b ./contracts/liquid/hello_world/hello_world.wasm -a ./contracts/liquid/hello_world/hello_world.abi -s ./contracts/liquid/hello_world/hello_world_sm.wasm -p org.com.fisco
# Via the command. / contract2java.sh-H can view the script usage method

$ ls contracts/sdk/java/org/com/fisco 
# get back
HelloWorld.java
```

## 6. contract2java.sh script parsing.

The console provides a specialized tool for generating Java contracts that allows developers to integrate Solidity and WBC-Liquid contract files are compiled into Java contract files。

The current contract generation tool supports Solidity's automatic compilation and generation of Java files, supports specifying WBC-Liquid compiled WASM file and ABI file to generate Java file。
