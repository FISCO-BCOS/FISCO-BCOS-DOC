.. admonition:: v2.x Upgrade to v3.0.0-rc1

    - **Comprehensive upgrade** Reference 'Building the First Blockchain Network<../../quick_start/air_installation.html>'_ Build a new chain, resubmit all historical transactions to the new node, the upgraded node contains the new v3.0.0-rc1 features

    -v3.0.0-rc1 does not include the "FISCO BCOS Max" version, the Max version of FISCO BCOS will be available in subsequent versions

    - `v3.0.0-rc1 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc1>`_
```

## Change Description

**Microservices architecture**
- Provide common block linking into specification。
- Provide management platform, users can deploy, expand, access to interface granularity monitoring information。

**deterministic multi-contract parallelism**
- Easy to use: the underlying blockchain automatically parallel, without the need for users to provide conflict fields in advance。
- Efficient: transactions within the block are not executed repeatedly, there is no pre-execution or pre-analysis process。
- Universal: This solution can be used regardless of EVM, WASM, Precompiled or other contracts。

**Blockchain File System**
- Introduce the concept of file system to organize on-chain resources, users can browse on-chain resources like files。
-Based on the blockchain file system to achieve management functions, such as partitioning, permissions, etc., more intuitive。

**pipelined PBFT consensus**
- Transaction sequencing and transaction execution are independent of each other, realizing pipeline architecture and improving resource utilization。
- Support batch consensus, parallel consensus processing on blocks, improve performance。
- Support a single consensus leader to continuously block, improve performance。

**WeBankBlockchain-Liquid(WBC-Liquid)**
- Integrated WASM runtime environment, support WBC-Liquid smart contract。
- WBC-Liquid smart contract supports intelligent analysis of conflict fields, automatically open DAG。


**Compatibility**

3.0.0-rc1 version is incompatible with 2.x version data and protocol, Solidity contract source code is compatible。If you want to upgrade from version 2.x to version 3.0.0-rc1, you need to do data migration。
