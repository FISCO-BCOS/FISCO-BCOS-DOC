# v3.0.0-rc4

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.x upgrade to v3.0.0-rc4

    - **Comprehensive upgrade** Reference 'Building the First Blockchain Network<../..//quick_start/air_installation.html>'_ Build a new chain, resubmit all historical transactions to the new node, the upgraded node contains the new v3.0.0-rc3 features

    - v3.0.0-rc4 is not compatible with v3.0.0-rc3, inter-version compatibility support is expected from the official version

    - `v3.0.0-rc4 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc4>`_
```

## Change Description

### New

- 'Max' version FISCO-BCOS is implemented, the storage adopts distributed storage TiKV, the execution module is independent into a service, the storage and execution can be horizontally expanded, and supports automatic master and backup recovery, which can support massive transactions on the chain scene
-Fully design and implement a compatibility framework from data to protocol layer to ensure the safe upgrade of protocols and data
- Support CRUD contract interface, simplify the blockchain application development threshold
- Support group ring signature contract interface, rich on-chain privacy computing capacity
- Support contract lifecycle management functions, including contract freezing and unfreezing
- Support data drop disk encryption
- based on 'mtail'+ `prometheus` + `grafana` + 'ansible 'to achieve blockchain system monitoring

### Change

- Introducing KeyPage to optimize read storage performance
- Based on the principle of Rip protocol, the network forwarding function is realized, and the network robustness is improved
- Support Linux aarch64 platform
- Update permission governance contracts to incorporate node role management, system configuration modification, contract lifecycle management and other functions into the governance framework
- Reconstruct the permission governance contract, and the calculation logic can be upgraded
- Optimize the performance of the DMC execution framework
- Optimize network performance for RPC and P2P
- Optimize the FISCO-BCOS chain creation script in the 'Pro' version, and support the configuration of RPC, Gateway, BcosNodeService and other services in the organization dimension
- The node's VM type configuration, permission management switch, and initialization account address are all changed in the creation block, and cannot be modified

### Repair

- Fix [#issue 2448](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/issues/2448)

### Compatibility

3.0.0-rc4 version is incompatible with 3.0.0-rc3 version data and protocol, Solidity / WBC-Liquid contract source code is compatible。If you want to upgrade from version 3.0.0-rc3 to version 3.0.0-rc4, you need to do data migration。
