    - **Comprehensive upgrade** : Refer to 'Build the first blockchain network <.. /.. / / quick _ start / air _ installation.html >' _ Build a new blockchain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains v3.0.0-rc3 new features

    - v3.0.0-rc4 and v3.0.0-rc3 not compatible, interversion compatibility support expected from official version

    - `v3.0.0-rc4 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc4>`_
```

## Change Description

### New

- Implementing 'Max' Version FISCO-BCOS, the storage adopts distributed storage TiKV, the execution module is independent into a service, the storage and execution can be horizontally expanded, and supports automatic master and backup recovery, which can support the massive transaction chain scene.
- Completely design and implement a compatibility framework from the data to the protocol layer to ensure secure upgrades of protocols and data
- Support CRUD contract interface, simplify blockchain application development threshold
- Support group ring signature contract interface, rich on-chain privacy computing capacity
- Support contract lifecycle management functions, including contract freezing and unfreezing
- Support data drop disk encryption
- Based on 'mtail'+ `prometheus` + `grafana` + 'ansible 'to achieve blockchain system monitoring

### Change

- Introducing KeyPage to optimize read storage performance
- Based on the principle of Rip protocol, realize network forwarding function and improve network robustness
- Support Linux aarch64 platform
- Update permission governance contracts to incorporate node role management, system configuration modification, contract lifecycle management, and other functions into the governance framework.
- Reconstruct the rights governance contract, and the calculation logic can be upgraded.
- Optimize the performance of the DMC execution framework
- Optimize network performance for RPC and P2P
- Optimize the 'Pro' version of FISCO-BCOS chain creation script, supports configuring RPC, Gateway, BcosNodeService and other services in the organization dimension
- The VM type configuration, permission management switch, and initialization account address of the node are all changed in the creation block and cannot be modified.

### Repair

- Repair [#issue 2448](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/issues/2448)

### Compatibility

3.0.0-rc4 version with 3.0.0-rc3 version data and protocol incompatible, Solidity / WBC-Liquid contract source code compatible。If you want to go from 3.0.0-rc3 version upgrade to 3.0.0-rc4 version, data migration is required。
