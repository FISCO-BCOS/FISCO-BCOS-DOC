    - **Comprehensive upgrade** : Refer to 'Build the first blockchain network <.. /.. / quick _ start / air _ installation.html >' _ Build a new blockchain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains v3.0.0-rc3 new features

    - v3.0.0-rc3 does not include the "FISCO BCOS Max" version, the Max version of FISCO BCOS will be available in subsequent versions

    - v3.0.0-rc3 with v3.0.0-rc1 incompatible, expected from v3.0.0-rc4 for inter-version compatibility support

    - `v3.0.0-rc3 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc3>`_
```
