    - **Comprehensive upgrade** : Refer to 'Build the first blockchain network <.. /.. / quick _ start / air _ installation.html >' _ Build a new blockchain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains v3.0.0-rc2 new features

    - v3.0.0-rc2 does not include the "FISCO BCOS Max" version, the Max version of FISCO BCOS will be available in subsequent versions

    - v3.0.0-rc2 and v3.0.0-rc1 incompatible, expected from v3.0.0-rc4 for inter-version compatibility support

- Repair DMC+Inconsistent execution during DAG scheduling
- Fix [Issue 2132](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/issues/2132)
- Repair [Issue 2124](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/issues/2124)
- Fix some scenarios, the new node is connected to the network and does not trigger the quick view switch, resulting in the number of nodes meeting '(2*f+1)'But the problem of abnormal consensus
- Fix the problem that some variable access threads are unsafe and cause node crash.
- Fix AMOP Subscription Multiple topics Failure

**Compatibility**

3.0.0-rc2 version with 3.0.0-rc1/2.0+Version data and protocol incompatible, Solidity / WBC-Liquid contract source code compatible。If you want to go from 3.0.0-rc1/2.0+Version Upgrade to 3.0.0-rc2 version, data migration is required。
