# [v2.0.0-rc3](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc3)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.0.0-rc2 upgrades to v2.0.0-rc3

    - **Compatible upgrade** : Directly replace the binary of the v2.0.0-rc2 node with `rc3 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.0.0-rc3/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_. The upgraded version fixes bugs in v2.0.0-rc2 but does not enable the new features in v2.0.0-rc3.  **after upgrading to v2.0.0-rc3, cannot roll back to v2.0.0-rc2**

    - **Full upgrade** : Refer to `Install <../installation.html>`_ to build new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains the new features in v2.0.0-rc3.

    - `v2.0.0-rc3 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc3>`_
```

## Change description

**New features**

* Distributed storage: [The new support for underlying connecting to MySQL directly through database connection pool]
(../manual/distributed_storage.html#id2)
* Distributed storage: [The new support for RocksDB engine, which to be used for storage by default when building new chain]
(../manual/configuration.html#id14)
* Distributed storage: [The new support for CRUD interface. The console in 1.0.3 version or above provides class SQL statements to read and write blockchain data](../console/console.html#create-sql)


**Updates**

* complete the ABI decoding module
* modify the error codes in precompiled contract and RPC interface and unify them to negative number
* optimize the storage module; increase the cache layer and support to configure cache size
* optimize the storage module; allow to submit block in pipelining. You can configure `[storage] .max_capacity` to control the memory size that is allowed
* move the distributed storage configuration item `[storage]` from the group genesis file to the group ini configuration file
* the default storage is upgraded to RocksDB and still supports the old version of LevelDB
* adjust the splicing logic of transaction mutex variables to improve the degree of parallelism of the transactions between different contracts

**Fix**

* fix the abnormal termination that may occur when CRUD interface contract opens parallel

## Compatibility note

RC3 **Forward Compatibility**. The older versions can directly upgrade by replacing program, but they cannot launch the new features for this release. If you need to use the new features, you need to build chain again.
