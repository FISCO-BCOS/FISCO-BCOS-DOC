```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.5.x upgraded to v2.6.0

    - **Compatible upgrade** ：Directly replace the binary of the v2.5.x node with the `v2.6.0 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.6.0/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_ , new features and changes list below.

    - **Full upgrade** ：Refer to `Installation <../ installation.html>`_ to build a new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node includes new features in v2.6.0

    - `v2.6.0 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.6.0>`_
```

## Change description

**Added**

- Added support for Kylin operating system V10 (Kunpeng-920/ARM aarch64)
- Added support for Solidity 0.6
- Added time alignment mechanism between nodes
- Added support for IPv6
- Added group SDK whitelist mechanism, which is disabled by default
- Added `getBlockheaderByNumber/getBlockHeaderByHash` to get block header
- Added support for configuring block execution timeout time

**Changed**

- The rPBFT consensus algorithm introduces the VRF random number algorithm to further ensure the security of the consensus algorithm
- The evm engine aleth-interpreter is replaced by evmone
- Upgrade the EVMC interface version to 7.3.0
- Source code compilation requires GCC version not less than 5.4.0
- Support AMOP message routing to the node itself
- In MySQL storage mode, block and other data use binary format and enable compression


**Fixed**

- Fixed a minor memory leak caused by the transaction broadcast tag cache not being cleaned up
- Fixed the issue that transactions in the transaction pool of non-leader nodes cannot be packaged under the raft consensus
- In MySQL storage mode, when the select interface of TablePrecompiled is called in the Solidity contract writing interface, the occasional gas calculation inconsistency problem occurs
- The wrong certificate generated by the user causes coredump problems
- Using assembly in Solidity to call the Ethereum precompiled contract 0x1-0x9, return success(value:0) for wrong input

**Compatibility**

The old version can directly replace the program upgrade

**Compatibility mode rollback to v2.5.x method**

After a node is upgraded from v2.5.x to v2.6.0 in compatibility mode, the rollback can be completed directly by replacing the node binary back to v2.5.x.
