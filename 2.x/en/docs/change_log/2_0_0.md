# [v2.0.0](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.0.0-rc3 upgrades to v2.0.0

    - **Compatible upgrade** : Directly replace the binary of the v2.0.0-rc3 node with `v2.0.0 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.0.0/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_. The upgraded version fixes bugs in v2.0.0-rc3 but does not enable the new features in v2.0.0.  **after upgrading to v2.0.0, cannot roll back to v2.0.0-rc3**

    - **Full upgrade** : Refer to `Install <../installation.html>`_ to build new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains the new features in v2.0.0.

    - `v2.0.0 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0>`_
```
