# Hardware requirements

```eval_rst
.. note::
    Since multiple nodes share network bandwidth, CPU, and memory resources, it is not recommended to configure too much nodes on one machine in order to ensure the stability of service.

```

The following table is a recommended configuration for single-group and single-node. Node consumes resources in a linear relationship with the number of groups. You can configure the number of nodes reasonably according to actual business requirement and machine resource.

| configuration     | minimum | recommended                                    |
