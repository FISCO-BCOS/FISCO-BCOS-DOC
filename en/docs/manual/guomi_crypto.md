# OSCCA-approved cryptography

For fully supporting the OSCCA-approved cryptography algorithm, FISCO integrates the national encryption, decryption, signature, verification, hash algorithm and SSL communication protocol in the FISCO BCOS platform based on the OSCCA-approved cryptography standard. The design documents can be found in the [FISCO BCOS Design Manual. OSCCA-approved cryptography Version](../design/features/guomi.md).

## Initial deployment of FISCO BCOS OSCCA-approved cryptography version

This section uses the [`build_chain`] (build_chain.md) script to build a 4-nodes FISCO BCOS chain locally, and uses `Ubuntu 16.04` system as an example to operate. This section uses pre-compiled static `fisco-bcos` binaries for testing on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04.

```bash
# rely on the installation of Ubuntu16
$ sudo apt install -y openssl curl
# prepare environment
$ cd ~ && mkdir -p fisco && cd fisco
# download build_chain.sh script
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/dev/tools/get_buildchain.sh)
```

After performing the above steps, the structure in the fisco directory is as follows:

```bash
fisco
├── bin
│   └── fisco-bcos
└── build_chain.sh
```

- build a 4-nodes FISCO BCOS chain

```bash
# Generate a 4-nodes FISCO chain. All nodes belong to group1. The following instructions are executed in the fisco directory.
# -p specifies the starting ports which are p2p_port, channel_port, jsonrpc_port
# According to the following instructions, it needs to ensure that the 30300~30303, 20200~20203, 8545~8548 ports of the machine are not occupied.
# -g The OSCCA-approved cryptography compilation option. It will generate a node of OSCCA-approved cryptography after using successfully. Download the latest version from GitHub by default.
$ ./build_chain.sh -l "127.0.0.1:4" -p 30300,20200,8545 -g
```

For the `build_chain.sh` script option, please [refer to here] (build_chain.md). The command that execute normally will output `All completed`. (If there is no output, refer to `nodes/build.log` for checking).

After the deployment of the OSCCA-approved cryptography alliance chain is completed, the rest of operations are same as [installation] (../installation.md).

## OSCCA-approved cryptography configuration information

The nodes of FISCO BCOS OSCCA-approved cryptography version message through using SSL secure channel. The main configuration items of the SSL certificate are concentrated in the following configuration items:

```ini
[network_security]

data_path：path where the certificate file is located
key：the path of the node private key relative to the data_path
cert: the path of the certificate gmnode.crt relative to data_path
ca_cert: the path of certificate gmca

;certificate configuration
[network_security]
    ;directory the certificates located in
    data_path=conf/
    ;the node private key file
    key=gmnode.key
    ;the node certificate file
    cert=gmnode.crt
    ;the ca certificate file
    ca_cert=gmca.crt
```

## using OSCCA-approved cryptography SDK

For details, refer to [SDK Documentation] (../sdk/sdk.html#id8).

## using OSCCA-approved cryptography console

The function of OSCCA-approved cryptography console is used in the same way as the standard console. See [Console Operations Manual] (../manual/console.md).

## OSCCA-approved cryptography configuration

### OSCCA-approved cryptography Key Manager

Using the OSCCA-approved cryptography Key Manager needs to be recompiled the standard Key Manager. The difference of them is ``` -DBUILD_GM=ON ``` option needs to be added when doing cmake.

``` shell
# under centos
cmake3 .. -DBUILD_GM=ON
# under ubuntu
cmake .. -DBUILD_GM=ON
```

Other steps are same as the standard Key Manager. Please refer to [key-manager repository](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/key-manager).

### OSCCA-approved cryptography node configuration

FISCO BCOS OSCCA-approved cryptography version adopts dual certificate mode, so two sets of certificates are needed for disk encryption. They  are the conf/gmnode.key and conf/origin_cert/node.key. Other operations of disk encryption are the same as [Standard Edition Loading Encryption Operation] (./storage_security.md).


``` shell
cd key-manager/scripts
#encrypt conf/gmnode.key parameter: ip port  Node private key file cipherDataKey
bash encrypt_node_key.sh 127.0.0.1 31443 nodes/127.0.0.1/node0/conf/gmnode.key ed157f4588b86d61a2e1745efe71e6ea 
#encrypt conf/origin_cert/node.key parameter: ip port  Node private key file cipherDataKey
bash encrypt_node_key.sh 127.0.0.1 31443 nodes/127.0.0.1/node0/conf/origin_cert/node.key ed157f4588b86d61a2e1745efe71e6ea 
```
