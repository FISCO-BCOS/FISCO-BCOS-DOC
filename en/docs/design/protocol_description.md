## Transaction structure and its RLP coding description

The transaction structure of FISCO BCOS has been increased or decreased some fields based on the transaction structure of the original Ethereum. The transaction structure fields of FISCO BCOS 2.0.0 are as follows:

| name           | type            | description                                                  | RLP index | RLP index RC2 |

| type           | enum            | Transaction type, represents whether the transaction is a contract creatio -             |n or a contract transaction, initially an empty contract. | -         |

The generation process of the hashWith field (also called transaction hash/transaction unique identifier) in RC1 is as follows:

It is similar with RC2 generation process, only that the transaction struct of `rlp+hash` in the first step is added with chainId, groupId, extraData the three fields.

## Block structure and its RLP coding description

The block of FISCO BCOS consists of the following five parts:

## Network transmission protocol

FISCO BCOS currently has two types of data packet formats. The data packets communicated among nodes are in the P2PMessage format, and the data packets communicated between nodes and SDK are in the ChannelMessage format.

![](../../images/node_management/message_type.png)

### P2PMessage: v2.0.0-rc2

V2.0.0-rc2 has expanded the range of **group ID and model ID**, **supporting 32767 groups at most**. It has also increased **Version** field for other features (like network compression) with package header being 16 bytes. The network data package structure of v2.0.0-rc2 is as below:

![](../../images/features/network_packet.png)

| name       | type         | description                          |
| :--------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Length     | uint32_t     | length of data package, containing header and data             |
| Version    | uint16_t     | it records version and features information of data package, currently the highest 0x8000 is to record if the data package is compressed or not|
| groupID (GID)    | int16_t  | group ID, ranging from 1-32767   |
| ModuleID (MID)   | uint16_t | model ID, ranging from 1-65535   |
| PacketType | uint16_t     | data packet type, sub-protocol identification with same mode ID  |
| Seq        | uint32_t     | data packet serial number, each increment itself         |
| Data       | vector<byte> | data itself, length length-12           |

For definitions of P2PMessage before v2.0.0-rc2, please [refer here.](https://fisco-bcos-documentation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/v2.0.0-rc3/docs/design/protocol_description.html#p2pmessage-v2-0-rc1)

**Additional**

1. P2PMessage does not limit the packet size, and the packet size management is performed by the upper layer calling module (consensus/synchronization/AMOP, etc.);
2. The group ID and module ID can uniquely identify the protocol ID, and the relationship among them is `protocolID = (groupID << sizeof(groupID)*8) | ModuleID`;
3. The data packet distinguishes between request packet and response packet by the 16-bit binary value where the protocolID is located.  The data greater than 0 is the request packet, and less than 0 is the corresponding packet.
4. The packetType currently used by AMOP include `SendTopicSeq = 1，RequestTopics = 2，SendTopics = 3`.

### ChannelMessage v2

[ChannelMessage v1 Please refer here](https://fisco-bcos-documentation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/v2.0.0/docs/design/protocol_description.html#channelmessage-v1)
