# Introduction

FISCO BCOS is the first safe and controllable enterprise-level financial consortium blockchain platform open source by domestic enterprises. It is jointly created by the FISCO open source working group and officially launched in December 2017.

The community links multiple parties with open source. As of May 2020, more than 1000 enterprises and institutions and more than 10,000 community members have joined to build and co-governance, and developed into the largest and most active domestic consortium blockchain platform ecosystem. The underlying platform is highly available and easy to use after extensive application and practice. Hundreds of application projects are developed based on the FISCO BCOS underlying platform, and over 80 have been steadily operating in the production environment, covering cultural copyright, judicial services, government services, Internet of Things, finance, smart communities and other fields.

## Architecture

In 2.0, FISCO BCOS innovatively proposed a "one-body, two-wing, multi-engine" architecture to achieve horizontal expansion of system throughput and greatly improve performance. It has industry in terms of security, operation and maintenance, ease of use, and scalability, and leading edge.

![](../images/architecture/plane.jpg)

The 'One-body' refers to the group structure, supports the rapid formation of consortium blockchain, and allows companies to build chains as easily as chat groups. According to business scenarios and business relationships, enterprises can choose different groups to form data sharing and consensus of multiple different ledgers, thereby quickly enriching business scenarios, expanding business scale, and greatly simplifying the deployment and operation and maintenance costs of the chain.

The 'two wings' refer to supporting parallel computing models and distributed storage, both of which bring better scalability to the group architecture. The former changes the method of serial execution in the order of transactions in the block, and executes transactions in parallel based on DAG (directed acyclic graph), which greatly improves performance. The latter supports enterprises (nodes) to store data in remote distributed systems, overcoming many limitations of localized data storage.


'Multi-engine' is a summary of a series of functional features. For example, pre-compiled contracts can break through the performance bottleneck of EVM and achieve high-performance contracts; the console allows users to quickly master blockchain usage skills.

The above features all focus on solving the pain points of technology and experience, provide more tool support for development, operation and maintenance, governance and supervision, make the system process faster and have higher capacity, and make the application operating environment safer and more stable.

## Core module

FISCO BCOS adopts high-throughput scalable [multi-group architecture](./design/architecture/group.md), which can dynamically manage multiple chains and groups to meet the expansion and isolation requirements of multiple business scenarios. Modules include:

- <font color=blue>**[Consensus mechanism](./design/consensus/index.md)**</font>: Pluggable consensus mechanism, supporting PBFT, Raft and rPBFT consensus algorithms, low transaction confirmation delay, high throughput, and ultimate consistency. Among them, PBFT and rPBFT can solve Byzantine problems and have higher security.

- <font color=blue>**[Storage](./design/storage/index.md)**</font>: The storage of the world state is changed from the original MPT storage structure to [distributed storage](./design/storage/storage.md), avoids the problem of performance degradation caused by the rapid expansion of the world state. Introduces a pluggable storage engine, supports LevelDB, RocksDB, MySQL and other back-end storage, supports data expansion quickly and easily, and isolates calculation from data, reducing the impact of node failure on node data.

- <font color=blue>**[Network](./design/p2p/p2p.md)**</font>: Support network compression, and implement a good distributed network distribution mechanism based on the idea of load balancing to minimize bandwidth overhead.

## Performance

In order to improve system performance, FISCO BCOS optimizes transaction execution in terms of improving transaction execution efficiency and concurrency, so that transaction processing performance can reach more than 10,000 levels.
