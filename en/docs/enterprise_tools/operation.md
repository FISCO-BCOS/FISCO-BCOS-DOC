### create_group_genesis (-c)

|  |  |
| :-: | :-: |
| Command description | generate group Genesis Block |
| Premise of use | user needs to configure `group_genesis.ini` and node certificates under meta folder.  |
| Parameter setting | assign and generate node configuration file folder for group |
| Function | generate configuration of new group under assigned section according to the certificates user configured under meta folder |
| Adaptable scenario | the existed nodes on consortium chain needs to form new group |

Operation Tutorial

```bash
$ cp node0/node.crt ./meta/cert_127.0.0.1_3030n.crt
...
$ vim ./conf/group_genesis.ini
$ ./generator --create_group_genesis ~/mydata
```

After the program is executed, `group.i.genesis` of mgroup.ini will be generated under ~/mydata folder

The generated `group.i.genesis` is the Genesis Block of the new group.

```eval_rst
.. note::
    In FISCO BCOS 2.0, each group has one Genesis Block.
```

| Adaptable scenario | generate node configuration file folder |

Operation Tutorial

```bash
$ vim ./conf/node_deployment.ini
$ ./generator --build_install_package ./peers.txt ~/mydata
```

After the program is executed, a few file folders named node_hostip_port will be generated under ~/mydata folder and pushed to the relative server to activate node.

### generate_chain_certificate

|  |  |
| :-: | :-: |
| Command description | generate root certificate |
| Premise of use | no |
| Parameter setting | assign file folder for root certificate |

```

```eval_rst
.. note::
    the above command will create node certificate according to ca.crt, agency certificate agency.crt and agency private key agency.key of meta folder.

    - absence of any of the above 3 files will fail the creation of node certificate, and the program will throw an exception

```

Once the execution is done, user can find node certificate and private key under ./cert folder, and node certificate under ./meta folder.

### merge_config (-m)

--merge_config command can merge p2p sections of 2 config.ini

For instance, the p2p section in config.ini of A is:

```ini
[p2p]
listen_ip = 127.0.0.1
listen_port = 30300
node.0 = 127.0.0.1:30300
node.1 = 127.0.0.1:30301
node.2 = 127.0.0.1:30302
node.3 = 127.0.0.1:30303
```

the p2p section in config.ini of B is:

```ini
[p2p]
listen_ip = 127.0.0.1
listen_port = 30303
node.0 = 127.0.0.1:30300
node.1 = 127.0.0.1:30303
node.2 = 192.167.1.1:30300
node.3 = 192.167.1.1:30301
```
the command will result in:

```ini
[p2p]
listen_ip = 127.0.0.1
listen_port = 30304
node.0 = 127.0.0.1:30300
node.1 = 127.0.0.1:30301
node.2 = 192.167.1.1:30302
node.3 = 192.167.1.1:30303
node.4 = 192.167.1.1:30300
node.5 = 192.167.1.1:30301
```

For example:

```bash
$ ./generator --merge_config ~/mydata/node_A/config.ini  ~/mydata/node_B/config.ini
```

When it works, the p2p sections in config.ini of node_A and node_B will be merged to ~/mydata/node_B/config.ini

### deploy_private_key (-d)

--deploy_private_key command will import the private key of nodes with same name to the generated configuration file folder

For example:

```bash
$./generator --deploy_private_key ./cert ./data
```

If ./cert contains file folders named node_127.0.0.1_30300 and node_127.0.0.1_30301, which are placed with node private key node.key,

./data contains file folders named node_127.0.0.1_30300 and node_127.0.0.1_30301,

then this command would import private key under./cert to ./data folder

### add_peers (-p)

--add_peers command can import the files of assigned peers to the generated node configuration file folder.

For example:

```bash
$./generator --add_peers ./meta/peers.txt ./data
```

If ./data contains configuration file folder named node_127.0.0.1_30300 and node_127.0.0.1_30301,

then this command will import peers file with connection information  to the node configuration files `config.ini` under ./data.

### add_group (-a)

--add_group command will import assigned peers file to the generated node configuration file folder.

For example:

```bash
$./generator --add_group ./meta/group.2.genesis ./data
```

If ./data contains configuration file folder named node_127.0.0.1_30300 and node_127.0.0.1_30301,

then this command will import connection information of Group 2 to `conf` folder of all nodes under ./data.

### download_fisco

--download_fisco can download `fisco-bcos` binary file under assigned section.

For example:

```bash
$./generator --download_fisco ./meta
```

This command can download `fisco-bcos` executable binary file under ./meta folder.

### download_console

--download_consolecan download and control console under assigned section.

For example:

```bash
$./generator --download_console ./meta
```

This command will configure the console under ./meta folder according to `node_deployment.ini`.

### get_sdk_file

--get_sdk_file command can acquire `node.crt`, `node.key`, `ca.crt` and `applicationContext.xml` that are needed in configuration of console and sdk under assigned section.

For example:

```bash
$./generator --get_sdk_file ./sdk
```

This command will generate the above configuration file according to `node_deployment.ini` under ./sdk

### version (-v)

--version command can help view the version code of current deployment tool.

```bash
$ ./generator --version
```

### help (-h)

User can use -h or --help command to check help list

For example:

```bash
$ ./generator -h
usage: generator [-h] [-v] [-b peer_path data_dir] [-c data_dir]
                 [--generate_chain_certificate chain_dir]
                 [--generate_agency_certificate agency_dir chain_dir agency_name]
                 [--generate_node_certificate node_dir agency_dir node_name]
                 [--generate_sdk_certificate sdk_dir agency_dir] [-g]
                 [--generate_all_certificates cert_dir] [-d cert_dir pkg_dir]
                 [-m config.ini config.ini] [-p peers config.ini]
                 [-a group genesis config.ini]
```

## Operation in OSCCA standard (China)

All the commands in FISCO BCOS generator are adaptable for commercial version of `fisco-bcos` (oscca-approved encryption). When using this version, every certificates and private key should be prefixed with `gm`. The description reads below:

### On-off switch (-g command)

Once -g command is executed, all the operations concerning certificates, nodes and group Genesis Block will generate the above files of OSCCA standard.

### generate certificate

When executing generate_*_certificate together with -g command, the generated certificate will be in OSCCA standard.

For example:

```
$ ./generator --generate_all_certificates ./cert -g
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
    the above command will generate node certificate according to gmca.crt, agency certificate gmagency.crt and agency private key gmagency.key placed under meta folder.

    - Absence of any one of the three files will fail the generation of node certificate, and the program will throw an exception.
```

### generate group Genesis Block in OSCCA standard

For example:

```bash
$ cp node0/gmnode.crt ./meta/gmcert_127.0.0.1_3030n.crt
...
$ vim ./conf/group_genesis.ini
$ ./generator --create_group_genesis ~/mydata -g
```

After executing this program, user can locate `group.i.genesis` in mgroup.ini under ~/mydata folder.

`group.i.genesis` is the Genesis Block of the new group.

### generate node configuration file folder in OSCCA standard

For example:

```bash
$ vim ./conf/node_deployment.ini
$ ./generator --build_install_package ./peers.txt ~/mydata -g
```

After executing program, multiple folders named node_hostip_port will be generated under ~/mydata folder and pushed to the relative server to activate node.

## Monitoring design

FISCO BCOS generator has preset monitoring script in all generated node configuration folders. Warning information of node will be sent to  IP address assigned by user after configuration. FISCO BCOS generator places the monitoring script under the assigned section for node configuration files. If user assigns the folder named "data", then user can locate it under monitor folder of data section.

For example:

```
$ cd ./data/monitor
```

Purpose of use:

1. to monitor status of node, to reactive node
2. to acquire block number of node and view information, to ensure the consensus of nodes
3. to analyze printing of node logs in last 1 minutes, to collect critical errors information of printed logs, to monitor status of node in real time
4. to assign log file or time period, to analyze information of consensus message management, block generation and transaction volume and node's health.

### Warning service configuration

Before using this service, user needs to configure the warning service. Here we take the WeChat notification of [server酱](http://sc.ftqq.com/3.version) as an example. You can read the configuration as reference: [server酱](http://sc.ftqq.com/3.version)

User associates it with personal github account and WeChat account, then uses -s command of this script to send warning message to the associated WeChat.

If user wants to try different services, user can personalize the service by modifying alarm() {
    # change http server  
} function of monitor.sh

### help command

The way to check the usage of script by help command

```bash
$ ./monitor.sh -h
Usage : bash monitor.sh
   -s : send alert to your address
   -m : monitor, statistics.  default : monitor .
   -f : log file to be analyzed.
   -o : dirpath
   -p : name of the monitored program , default is fisco-bcos
   -g : specified the group list to be analyzed
   -d : log analyze time range. default : 10(min), it should not bigger than max value : 60(min).
   -r : setting alert receiver
   -h : help.
 example :
   bash  monitor.sh -s YourHttpAddr -o nodes -r your_name
   bash  monitor.sh -s YourHttpAddr -m statistics -o nodes -r your_name
   bash  monitor.sh -s YourHttpAddr -m statistics -f node0/log/log_2019021314.log -g 1 2 -r your_name
```

Command description:

- -s assign the configuration address of warning service. It can be the ip of warning notification.
- -m set monitor mode to statistics or monitor. Monitor is the default mode.
- -f analyze node log
- -o assign location of node
- -p set notification name. "fisco-bcos" is the default one.
- -g assign group to be monitored. All group is defaulted to be monitored.
- -d time scope of log analysis. Default to be within 10 minutes and 60 minutes as the maximum
- -r assign the receiver of warning notification
- -h help command

### For example

- use script to monitor status of assigned nodes, send message to receiver Alice:

```bash
$ bash monitor.sh -s https://sc.ftqq.com/[SCKEY(登入后可见)].send -o alice/nodes -r Alice
```

- use script to collect node information and send message to Alice:

```bash
$ bash monitor.sh -s https://sc.ftqq.com/[SCKEY(登入后可见)].send -m statistics -o alice/nodes -r Alice
```

- use script to collect information of group 1 and group 2 of specific node log, send message to Alice:

```bash
$ bash monitor.sh -s https://sc.ftqq.com/[SCKEY(登入后可见)].send -m statistics -f node0/log/log_2019021314.log -g 1 2 -o alice/nodes -r Alice
```

## handshake failed test

The `check_certificates.sh` script in scripts folder of FISCO BCOS generator contains anomaly detection with error message `handshake failed` in node log.

### Acquire test script

If user needs to test node generated by `buildchain.sh`, the following command can help acquire test script:

```bash
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FISCO-BCOS/generator/develop/scripts/check_certificates.sh && chmod u+x check_certificates.sh
```

User that deployed node with generator can acquire script from scripts/check_certificates.sh under the root directory of generator.

### Test valid date of certificate

-t command of `check_certificates.sh` can test certificate by comparing the valid date with the current system time.

Example:

```bash
$ ./check_certificates.sh -t ~/certificates.crt
```

The second parameter can be any x509 certificate that prompt `check certificates time successful` after passing verification or exception if fails.

### Certificate verification

-v command of `check_certificates.sh` will verify node certificate according to the root certificate set by user.

```bash
$ ./check_certificates.sh -v ~/ca.crt ~/node.crt
```
After successful verification it will prompt `use ~/ca.crt verify ~/node.crt successful`, or prompt exception if fails.
