# [v2.0.0-rc2](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc2)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.0.0-rc1 upgrade to v2.0.0-rc2

    - **Compatible upgrade** : Directly replace the binary of the v2.0.0-rc1 node with rc2 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.0.0-rc2/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_ . The upgraded version fixes bugs in v2.0.0-rc1 but does not enable the new features such as parallel computing, distributed storage, etc. in v2.0.0-rc2. **after upgrading to v2.0.0-rc2, cannot roll back to v2.0.0-rc1**
   - **Full upgrade** : Refer to Install  <../installation.html>`_  to build new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains the new features in v2.0.0-rc2.
    - `v2.0.0-rc2 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc2>`_

## Change description

**New features**

* [Parallel computing model](../manual/transaction_parallel.md): Parallel contract development framework, Parallel Transaction Executor (PTE)

* [Distributed storage](../manual/distributed_storage.md): amdb-proxy, SQLStorage

**Optimization**
* optimize the logic of [block packing transaction number](../manual/configuration.html#id15), and dynamically adjust the number of block packing transactions according to the execution time.
* optimize the process of block synchronization to make block synchronization faster
* optimize the codec of the upcoming transaction, the verification of the transaction and the coding of disk in parallel
* optimize the logic of transaction executing return code to make return code more accurate
* upgrade storage modules to support concurrent reading and writing

**Other features**

* add [network data packet compression](../design/features/network_compress.md)
* add [compatibility configuration](../manual/configuration.html#id7>)
* add chainID and group ID to the transaction code
* add binary cache in transaction
* add timestamp information in gensis block
* add some precompile demos
* support using [Docker to build chain](../manual/build_chain.md)
* delete unnecessary logs
* delete unnecessary and repeat operations

**Bug fix**

* [the bug of program exiting caused by asInt abnormity when processing parameters in RPC](https://security.webank.com/report/freelink/932/6673f4de1e4c4acaf69a0ebb474545a0)
* [the bug in which the transaction has not been processed in pool when the transaction executing 'Out of gas'](https://security.webank.com/report/freelink/871/cbb01ea45c9d2324c311f4f6fc1ec7ef)
* [the bug that can be replayed with the same transaction binary between different groups](https://security.webank.com/report/freelink/870/880c699de2f2d87bdf69c189d0ca42cd)
* the problems of performance degradation caused by 'insert' operation
* some stability problems have been fixed
