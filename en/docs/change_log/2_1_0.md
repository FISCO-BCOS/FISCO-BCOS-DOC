# [v2.1.0](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.0.x upgrades to v2.1.0

    - **Compatible upgrade** : Directly replace the binary of the v2.0.x node with `v2.1.0 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.1.0/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_. The upgraded version fixes bugs in v2.0.x but does not enable the new features in v2.1.0. In most cases, it is ok to rollback to v2.0.x after upgrading to v2.1.0. See the last section for more information.

    - **Full upgrade** : Refer to `Install <../installation.html>`_ to build new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node contains the new features in v2.1.0.

    - `v2.1.0 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.1.0>`_

## Change description

**Update**

- Support [Channel Message v2 protocol](../design/protocol_description.html#channelmessage-v2)
- Support to [configure node address with domain names](../manual/configuration.html#p2p)
- Increase max contract binary size limit to 256KB
- Output more detailed log for transaction exceptions
- Rename SDK certificate file names generated by build_chain.sh to sdk.crt and sdk.key

2.1.0 **is forward compatible**. Old versions can upgrade to this new version by directly replacing the binaries for bug fixing purpose. But the new features of this version cannot be enabled unless you deploy a new chain with only new binaries from scratch.

**Rollback to v2.0.x after compatible upgrading**

After compatible upgrading to v2.1.0, we can rollback by simply replacing `fisco-bcos` binary file to v2.0.x. If a large contract(binary size between 24K and 256K) is deployed after upgrading, rollback to v2.0.x may lead to block downloading error. In this case, we need to use v2.1.0 `fisco-bcos` to download blocks until newest block before rolling back.
