# [v2.4.0](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.4.0)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.3.x upgraded to v2.4.0

    - **Compatible upgrade** ：Directly replace the binary of the v2.3.x node with the `v2.4.0 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.4.0/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_ , the upgraded version fixes bugs in v2.3.x, and includes 2.4.0 dynamic group life cycle management function, network statistics function, but will not enable all the features of 2.4.0, in normal scenarios, you can roll back to v2.3.x. For the rollback method, refer to the last section of this article.

    - **Full upgrade** ：Refer to `Installation <../ installation.html>`_ to build a new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node includes new features in v2.4.0

    - `v2.4.0 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.4.0>`_
```

## Change description

**New features**

- Support dynamic group life cycle management: Related RPC interfaces include [generateGroup](../api.html#generategroup)、[startGroup](../api.html#startgroup)、[stopGroup](../api.html#stopgroup)、[removeGroup](../api.html#removegroup)、[recoverGroup](../api.html#recovergroup)、[queryGroupStatus](../api.html#querygroupstatus)

- Support [network traffic and Gas statistics](../design/features/stat.md)
- [Precompiled contract supports Gas](../design/virtual_machine/gas.html#precompiled-contract-supports-gas-calculation)
- [Support EVM Gas measurement standard plug-in configuration](../design/virtual_machine/gas.html#evm-gas-measurement-standard-plug-in)
- Add new interface [sendRawTransactionAndGetProof](../api.html#sendrawtransactionandgetproof) push transaction and transaction receipt proof

**Update**

- The minimum requirement of CMake is modified to 3.7, supporting multi-source download of dependent libraries 

**Fix**

- Fix the problem that the ecRecover interface is not available in the OSCCA-approved cryptography mode
- Fix the inconsistent return value of sha256 interface in OSCCA-approved cryptography mode and non-OSCCA-approved cryptography mode

**compatibility**

**Forward compatible**, The old version can directly replace the program upgrade, the replaced node fixes the bug in v2.3.x, and includes 2.4.0 dynamic group life cycle management function and network statistics function, to enable all new features in v2.4.0, you need to rebuild the blockchain.

**Compatibility mode rollback to v2.2.x method**

After a node is upgraded from v2.3.x to v2.4.0 in compatibility mode, the rollback can be completed directly by replacing the node binary back to v2.3.x.
