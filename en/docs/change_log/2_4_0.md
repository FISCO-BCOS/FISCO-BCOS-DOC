For the rollback method, refer to the last section of this article.

    - **Full upgrade** ：Refer to `Installation <../ installation.html>`_ to build a new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node includes new features in v2.4.0

**compatibility**

**Forward compatible**, The old version can directly replace the program upgrade, the replaced node fixes the bug in v2.3.x, and includes 2.4.0 dynamic group life cycle management function and network statistics function, to enable all new features in v2.4.0, you need to rebuild the blockchain.
