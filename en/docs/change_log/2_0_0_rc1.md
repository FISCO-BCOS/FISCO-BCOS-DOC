# [v2.0.0-rc1](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc1)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v1.x upgrades to v2.0.0-rc1

    - **v2.0.0-rc2 is not compatible with v1.x so v2.0.0-rc1 cannot directly parse the historical block data generated by v1.x**, but the old data can be recovered by performing historical transaction on the new chain at `v2.0.0-rc1 <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.0.0-rc1/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_

    - **build 2.0's new chain** : Refer to `install <../installation.html>`_

    - `v2.0.0-rc1 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc1>`_
```

## Change description

**Architecture**

1. [Add group architecture](../design/architecture/group.md): each group has independent consensus and storage. System throughput can be lateral spreading based on lower operation cost.
2. [Add distributed data storage](../design/storage/storage.md): supports nodes storing data in remote distributed systems to achieve computing and data isolation, high-speed capacity expansion, and data security level enhancement.
3. [Add support for precompiled contracts](../design/virtual_machine/precompiled.md): the underlying implements pre-compiled contract framework based on C++, is compatible with the solidity calling method, and improves the performance of smart contract execution.
4. [Introducing evmc extension framework](../design/virtual_machine/index.md): support for extending different virtual machine engines.
5. Upgrade remodeling [P2P](..//design/p2p/p2p.md), [consensus](../design/consensus/index.md), [sync](../design/sync/sync.md), [Transaction execution](../design/virtual_machine/index.md), transaction pool, block management module.

**Protocol**

1. Implement a set of [CRUD](../tutorial/sdk_application.md) basic data access interface specification contract. To compile business contracts based on CRUD interface to implement traditional SQL oriented business development process.

2. Support mechanisms such as transaction asynchronous notification, block putting on chain asynchronous notification, and custom AMOP message notification.

3. Upgrade Ethereum virtual machine version and support Solidity 0.5.2 version.

4. Upgrade [RPC module](../api.md).

**Security**

1. Upgrade[Disk encryption](../manual/storage_security.md) and provide private key management service. When the disk encryption function is enabled, to manage paivate key depands on KeyManager service.

2. Upgrade[Admission mechanism](../manual/node_management.md). Through introducing the network access mechanism and the group access mechanism, to control the access of chain and data in different dimensions.

3. Upgrade[Authority control system](../manual/distributed_storage.md). Design access permission based on table

**Others**

1. Provide an entry-level [building chain tool](../manual/build_chain.md).
2. Provide modular unit testing and end-to-end integration testing and support automated continuous integration and continuous deployment.
