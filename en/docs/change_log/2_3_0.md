# [v2.3.0](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: v2.2.x upgraded to v2.3.0

    - **Compatible upgrade** ：Directly replace the binary of the v2.2.x node with the `v2.3.0 binary <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/download/v2.3.0/fisco-bcos.tar.gz>`_ , the upgraded version fixes bugs in v2.2.x, but will not enable the new features of v2.3.0, in normal scenarios, you can roll back to v2.2.x. For the rollback method, refer to the last section of this article.

    - **Full upgrade** ：Refer to `Installation <../ installation.html>`_ to build a new chain and resubmit all historical transactions to the new node. The upgraded node includes new features in v2.3.0

    - `v2.3.0 Release Note <https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/releases/tag/v2.3.0>`_
```

## Change description

**New features**

- [Paillier encryption](../manual/privacy.html#homomorphic-encryption)：Paillier encryption is supported on the chain. To enable this function, please refer to [here](../manual/privacy.html#how-to-start)

- [Group Signature](../manual/privacy.html#group-ring-signature): v2.3.0 supports group signature verification and ring signature verification, provides [group signature server](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/group-signature-server) and [group signature client](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/group-signature-client) demo to realize the group signature generation, on-chain and on-chain verification.

- rPBFT: Based on the PBFT consensus algorithm, a new consensus algorithm rPBFT is implemented to minimize the impact of node size on the consensus algorithm, To configure rPBFT, please refer to [Consensus Configuration](../manual/configuration.html#consensus-configuration) and [rPBFT Consensus Configuration](../manual/configuration.html#rpbft-consensus-configurations)

- [KVTable](../manual/smart_contract.html#use-kvtable-contract-get-set-interface)：Provides key-based data reading and writing methods. Compared to [Table contract CRUD interface](../manual/smart_contract.html#to-use-table-contract-crud-interface), it is simpler and easier to use and maintain.

- [Contract management](../design/features/contract_management.md): Provide contract life cycle management interface, including [freeze](../console/console.html#freezecontract), [unfreeze](../console/console.html#unfreezecontract), [Contract Status Query](../console/console.html#getcontractstatus) and its related [Authorization](../console/console.html#grantcontractstatusmanager), [Permission Query](../console/console.html#listcontractstatusmanager) and other operations to facilitate the operation and maintenance personnel's management of the on-chain contract


**Update**

- [rpc.listen_ip split into channel_listen_ip and jsonrpc_listen_ip](../manual/configuration.html#configure-rpc)
- Provide contract write permission control interface, including contract write permission [authorization](../console/console.html#grantcontractwritepermission)、[revoke](../console/console.html#revokecontractwritepermission)和[query](../console/console.html#listcontractwritepermission)
- [Simplify parallel transaction configuration](../manual/configuration.html#parallel-transaction-configuration)
- [recommended to use MySQL directly connected storage mode instead of External storage mode](../manual/configuration.html#configure-storage)


**Fix**

- Fix memory issues in specific compatibility scenarios

**compatibility**

**Forward compatible**, The old version can directly replace the program upgrade, but cannot launch the new features of this version. If you want to use the new features of this version, you need to relink.

**Compatibility mode rollback to v2.2.x method**

After a node is upgraded from v2.2.x to v2.3.0 in compatibility mode, the rollback can be completed directly by replacing the node binary back to v2.2.x.
