## 2. Deploy

### 2.1 Environment dependency

| Environment     | Version              |
| ------ | --------------- |
| nginx   | nginx1.6 or above version    |

The install of nginx is introduced in Additional.


### 2.2 Pull code


Execute command: (when web and server are deployed on the same machine, it only needs to be pulled once)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/fisco-bcos-browser.git
```

```shell
cd fisco-bcos-browser
```

And then, place the dist directory in ./web/fisco-bcos-browser-front/ under /data/app/web directory.

**Tip:** the directory can be cutomized, as long as the step 2 of nginx config file is kept the same.

### 2.3 Modify nginx config

There is nginx config file under ./web/fisco-bcos-browser-front/doc, which can replace the installed nginx.conf;

**Note**：If nginx is installed as the way in Additional, the config file route is /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf.

And modify nginx.conf;

1. Modify IP address and port of web.
2. Modify web file route and point to dist directory that pulled code.
3. Modify IP and port of server. Please note that '/api' need not to be changed.

```Nginx
    server {
            listen       8081 default_server;   #Step 1, web nginx monitoring port
            server_name  192.168.0.1;         #Step 2, web address, can be configured as domain name
            location / {
                    root    /data/app/web/dist;   #Step 2, web file route
                    index  index.html index.htm;
                    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
                }

            # Load configuration files for the default server block.
            include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

            location /api {
                    proxy_pass    http://192.168.0.1:8088/;    #Step 3, IP and port of server (fisco-bcos-browser server)
               	 	proxy_set_header		Host				$host;
                    proxy_set_header		X-Real-IP			$remote_addr;
                    proxy_set_header		X-Forwarded-For		$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            }
            }
```

### 2.4 Start nginx

(1) Start nginx。
Start command:

```shell
/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx   
```
**Start exception report and troubleshooting:**

1. The log route is correct of not (error.log and access.log)
2. nginx has been added with access

(2) Open page, page url is the web port and IP configured by nginx
Example: the url of the above config file is http:192.168.0.1:8081

(3) Open page. configure group (group IP same as build chain), configure nodes (within the group), the we can access the data.
